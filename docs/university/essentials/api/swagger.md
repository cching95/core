# What is Swagger?

Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines are able to read them. By reading your API’s structure, Swagger automatically builds interactive API documentation and can also automatically generate client libraries for your API in many languages. To use Swagger efficiently, your API will need to return a YAML or JSON that contains a detailed description of your entire API. This file is essentially a resource listing of your API which adheres to [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md). The specification asks you to include information like:

* What are all the operations that your API supports?
* What are your API’s parameters and what does it return?
* Does your API need some authorization?
* And also things like terms, contact information and license to use the API.
